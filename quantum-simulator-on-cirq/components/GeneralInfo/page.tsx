                A Quantum Finite Machine (QFM) is a quantum analog of a classical finite automaton.
                It processes input symbols and transitions between states based on quantum operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                QFMs are used to study the computational power of quantum systems and their ability
                to recognize languages.
